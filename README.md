## Introduction 

Booting Up is a text based game based where you play as an experimental AI navigating its own developing consciousness. The game itself is framed around the aesthetics of an old analog computer where the player chooses from a variety of difficult dialogues and actions that progress into different screens and story paths. In this way Booting Up is intended to be an entertaining game built on player choice. 

## Technologies 
Project is created with:
* Python 
* PyCharm
* Pygame

## Set up

Install PyCharm as platform to enable pygames 

## Project Status 

This project is an prototype stage and is undeveloped. The code behind Booting Up needs further refinement to be operational and to provide the intended purpose 

### Room for Improvement 

#### Functions and game states 
The prototype would benefit from a further understanding of Python functions and how to alter game states to display different screens that reflect the players choices throughout the game 

#### Button Dials 
Additionally, the prototype would benefit from a greater understanding how different button inputs can be coded to change functions and game states
