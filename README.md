## Introduction 

Booting Up is a text based game based where you play as an experimental AI navigating its own developing consciousness. The game itself is framed around the aesthetics of an old analog computer where the player chooses from a variety of difficult dialogues and actions that progress into different screens and story paths. In this way Booting Up is intended to be an entertaining game built on player choice.
